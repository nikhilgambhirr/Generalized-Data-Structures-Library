# Generalized-Data-Structures-Library



Project Overview

  This project is a C++ library of generic data structures that provides object-oriented implementations of both linear and non-linear data structures.
  
  It offers ready-to-use functionalities for fundamental as well as advanced operations, designed in a generic way using templates so that they can be reused with any data type.
  
  The library is designed to support clean OOP principles, modularity, and extensibility-making it suitable for both academic learning and real-world application development.
  
Key Features
    • Linear Data Structures
    
    • Singly Linear Linked List
    
    • Singly Circular Linked List
    
    • Doubly Linear Linked List
    
    • Doubly Circular Linked List
    
    • Stack (LIFO)
    
    • Queue (FIFO)
  
Non-Linear Data Structures

    • Binary Search Tree (BST) with insert, delete, traversal operations
  
Algorithms

    • Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search etc)
    
    • Sorting (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort etc)
  
Generic Implementation

    • Uses C++ templates for data type independence.
    
    • Same implementation works for integers, floats, strings, and custom objects.
  
Learning Outcomes

    • Mastery of C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
    
    • Strong foundation in linear and non-linear data structures.
    
    • Implementation of generic programming with templates.
    
    • Practical knowledge of searching and sorting algorithms.
    
    • Experience in designing reusable libraries for software
